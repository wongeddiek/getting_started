-- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
-- If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

-- Problem 3: Largest prime factor
-- The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

-- starting with the 1st prime -- 2, if the number n is divisable by the prime p, add to the list.  Then strip n by repeatedly dividing it by p until it's no longer divisible by p.  Then recursively calls the function with the stripped n & p+1.  If n is not divisible by p, call function recursively with n & p+1.
