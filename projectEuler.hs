-- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
-- If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
-- Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below n.

-- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

-- Problem 3: Largest prime factor
-- The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
